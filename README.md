We created a C++ program that simulates pirate battles on the high seas using object-oriented programming principles. The goal is to practice fundamental concepts such as file I/O, class creation, and object manipulation, while adding a touch of pirate-themed humor and competition.
Phase 1: File I/O (5 points)

Create a file named pirates.txt containing details for 10 pirates (name, power, toughness, and shanty).
Use file input/output (I/O) in driver.cpp to read and display pirate information from the file.
Phase 2: Pirate Class (15 points)

Create a class called Pirate (in pirate.h) with attributes for the pirate's name, power, toughness, and battle cry.
Implement functions for initializing, getting values, and managing the pirate's attributes.
Use the Pirate class to create an array of pirates, loading data from pirates.txt.
Phase 3: Pirate Battle (10 points)

Simulate a battle between pirates using a fight function. Pirates attack each other using random values based on their power.
Keep track of the number of stabs for each pirate and determine the pirate with the fewest stabs after all the battles.
